This is a collection of brand new FGD files for Source engine games. Most of the information in them was rewritten from scratch by me to be more accurate, comprehensive, and easier to follow. A lot of things I've written in them are confirmed by in-game testing and checking code. New entities, flags, keyvalues, inputs and outputs were found by referring to dumpentityfactories, code, and SourceMod datamaps. Many outdated settings have also been removed. I also added/redid material exclusion (less clutter in the texture browser) and new visgroup categories.

They aren't perfect yet. Open an issue and tell me about any problems with them.

Progress:
- **Counter-Strike: Source**: ✔
- **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive**: ✔
